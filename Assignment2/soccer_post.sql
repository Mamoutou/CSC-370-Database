/*The questions in this assignment are about doing soccer analytics using SQL. 
The data is in tables England, France, Germany, Italy, and Spain.
These tables contain more than 100 years of soccer game statistics.
Follow the steps below to create your tables and familizarize yourself with the data. 
Then write SQL statements to answer the questions. 
The first time you access the data you might experience a small delay while DBeaver 
loads the metadata for the tables accessed. 

Submit this file after adding your queries. 
Replace "Your query here" text with your query for each question. 
Submit one spreadsheet file with your visualizations for questions 2, 7, 9, 10, 12 
(one sheet per question named by question number, e.g. Q2, Q7, etc).

/*Q1 (1 pt)
Find all the games in England between seasons 1920 and 1999 such that the total goals are at least 13. 
Order by total goals descending.*/

/*Q2 (2 pt)
For each total goal result, find how many games had that result. 
Use the england table and consider only the seasons since 1980.
Order by total goal.*/

/*Q3 (2 pt)
Find for each team in England in tier 1 the total number of games played since 1980. 
Report only teams with at least 300 games. 

Hint. Find the number of games each team has played as "home". 
Find the number of games each team has played as "visitor".
Then union the two and take the sum of the number of games.   */

Everton	   1451
Liverpool	   1451

/*Q4 (1 pt)
For each pair team1, team2 in England find the number of home-wins since 1980 of team1 versus team2.
Order the results by the number of home-wins in descending order.

Hint. After selecting the tuples needed (... WHERE tier=1 AND ...) do a GROUP BY home, visitor.

/*Q5 (1 pt)
For each pair team1, team2 in England find the number of away-wins since 1980 of team1 versus team2.
Order the results by the number of away-wins in descending order.*/

/*Sample result
Aston Villa	 Manchester United	 18

/*Q6 (2 pt)
For each pair team1, team2 in England report the number of home-wins and away-wins 
since 1980 of team1 versus team2. 
Order the results by the number of away-wins in descending order. 

Hint. Join the results of the two previous queries. To do that you can use those 
queries as subqueries. Remove their ORDER BY clause when making them subqueries.  
Be careful on the join conditions. */

of Arsenal versus team2 and the number of home-wins and away-wins of team2 versus Arsenal 
(all since 1980).
Order the results by the second number of away-wins in descending order.

/*Q8 (2 pt)
Winning at home is easier than winning as visitor. 
Nevertheless, some teams have won more games as a visitor than when at home.
Find the team in Germany that has more away-wins than home-wins in total.

/*Q9 (3 pt)
One of the beliefs many people have about Italian soccer teams is that they play much more defense than offense.
Catenaccio or The Chain is a tactical system in football with a strong emphasis on defence. 
In Italian, catenaccio means "door-bolt", which implies a highly organised and effective backline defence 
focused on nullifying opponents' attacks and preventing goal-scoring opportunities. 
In this question we would like to see whether the number of goals in Italy is on average smaller than in England. 

Find the average total goals per season in England and Italy since the 1970 season. 
The results should be (season, england_avg, italy_avg) triples, ordered by season.

Hint. 
Subquery 1: Find the average total goals per season in England. 
Subquery 2: Find the average total goals per season in Italy 
   (there is no totgoal in table Italy. Take hgoal+vgoal).
Join the two subqueries on season.  */
